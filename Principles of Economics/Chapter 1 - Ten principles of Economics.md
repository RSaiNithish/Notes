## 1.1 How people make decisions
___
### Principle 1: People face trade-offs:
 - To gain something we must forego something
 - Making decisions requires trading off one goal against another
 - Eg: 
	 - ***guns and butter***
	 - ***Efficiency and equality***
		 - **Efficiency**: The property of society getting the most it can from its scarce resources
		 - **Equality**: The property if dustributing economic prosperity uniformity among the members of society
		 - When government tries to cut the economic pie into more **equal slices,** the pie **shrinks**. 
### Principle 2: The cost of something is what you give up to get it
 - Making decisions requires comparing the costs and benefits of alternative courses of action.
 - **Oppurtunity cost**: Whatever must be given to obtain something.
 - Decision makers should take into account the oppurtunity costs of each possible action.

### Principle 3: Rational people think at the margin
 - **Rational people**: Peple who systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objective
 - Economists normally assume that the people are rational.
 - Rational people know that decisions in life are rarely black and white but often involves shades of grey
 - **Marginal change**: A small increase increamental adjustment to a plan of action.
 - Rational people make decisions by comparing *marginal benefits* and *marginal costs*.
 - A persons willingness to pay for a good is based on the **marginal benefit** that an extra unit of the good would yeild
	 - Water is essential, but the marginal benefit of an extra cup is small because water is plentiful. By contrast, no one needs diamonds to survive, but because diamonds are so rare, the marginal benefit of an extra diamond is large
 - A rational decision maker takes an action iff the action's marginal benefit exceeds its marginal cost.

### Principle 4: People respond to incentives
 - **Incentive**: Something that induces a person to act,such as prospect of a punishment or a reward.
 - Incentive plays a central role in economics. Incentive plays a central role in economics. 
	 - When price of apples rise, people decide to eat less and orchards decide to produce more.
	 - A higher price in the market provides an incentive for buyers to consume less and an incentive for sellers to produce more
 - Influence of prices on the behavior of consumers and producers is critical to how a market allocates scarce resources.
 - Public policymakers should never forget about incentives: Many policies change the costs or benefits that people face and as a result alter their behavior.


## 1.2 How people interact
___
### Principle 5: Trade can make everyone better off
 - Trade between two contries can make each country better off
 - Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety of goods and services.

### Principle 6: Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
 - **Market economy**: An economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services.
 - Prices are the instrument with which the invisible hand directs economic activity.
 - Market prices reflect both the value of a good to society and the cost to the society of making the good
 - When a government prevents prices from adjusting naturally to supply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand's ability to coordinate the decisions of the households and firms that make up an economy.

### Principle 7: Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
 - Invisible hand can work its magic only if the government enforces the rules and maintains the institutions that are key to a market economy.
 - Market economies need institutions to enforce property rights so individuals can own and control scarce resources
 - **Property rights**: The ability of an individual to own and exercise control over scarce resources
 - Another reason for government in the economy:
	 - To promote efficiency or to promote equality
	 - Most policies aim either to enlarge economic pie or to change how the pie is divided.
 - **Market failure**: A situation in which a market left on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently
 - **Externality**: The impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander
 - **Market power**: The ability of a single economic actor (or small group of actors) to have a substantial influence on market prices
 - A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce things that other people are willing to pay for.
 - In practice, many public policies such as income tax and welfare system aim to achieve a more equal distribution of economic well-being
 - To *say* that the government *can* improve market outcomes does not mean that it always *will*.


## 1.3 How the economy as a whole works
___
### Principle 8: A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
 - **Productivity**: The quantity of goods and services produced from each unit of labor input.
 - Differences in living standards around the world are staggering. 
 - Almost all variation in the living standards is attributed to differences in countries's productivity.
 -  Similarly, the growth rate of a nation's productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.
 - How policy will affect living standards? It depends on the ability to produce goods and services.

### Principle 9: Prices rise when the government prints too much money
 - **Inflation:** An increase in the overall level of prices in the economy.
 - High inflation imposes various costs on society, thus keeping inflation at a reasonable rate is a goal of economic policymakers around the world.
 - In most of the cases, the cause of inflation is growth in the quantity of money.

### Principle 10: Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
 - Short-run effects of money growth:
	 - Increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
	 - Higher demand may over time cause firms to raise their prices, but in the meantime, it also encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
	 - More hiring means lower unemployment.
- **Business cycle:** Fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production.
- Policymakers can exploit the short-run trade-off using various policy instruments.
	- By changing the amount that government spends, the amount it taxes and the amount of money it prints, policymakers can influence the overall demand for goods and services.
	- Changes in the demand in turn influence the combination of inflation and unemployment that the economy experiences in the short run.
