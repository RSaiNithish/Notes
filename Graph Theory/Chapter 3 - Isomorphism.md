## 3.1 Definition of Isomorphism
 - Two graphs G and H are **isomorphic** if $V(G)=V(H)$ and $E(G)=E(H)$ 
 - When the two graphs have same structure, i.e., if the vertices of G and H can be labeled (or relabeled) to produce two equal graphs.

 - **Isomorphic**: if there exists a one-to-one correspondence $\phi$ from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$  such that $uv \in E(G)$ iff $\phi(u)\phi(v) \in E(H)$.

### Theorems
 - **Theorem 3.1**: *Two graphs $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic iff their complements $\bar{G}$ and $\bar{H}$  are isomorphic.*

 - **Theorem 3.2:** *If $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic graphs, then the degrees of the vertices of $G$ are the degrees of the vertices of $H$*.

 - **Theorem 3.5**: *Let $G$ and $H$ be isomorphic graphs. Then
	 (a) $G$ is bipartite iff $H$ is bipartite 
	 (b) $G$ is connected iff $H$ is connected*
